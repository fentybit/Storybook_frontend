<strong>Domain Modeling :: Digital Journaling</strong><br>
Welcome to my simplistic version of digital journaling app.<br>

## About

<p>I have been a long-advocate for having meaningful connection through self-reflection. While some journal apps I have seen simply record special memories and events, some focus more on mental health, mindfulness and self-care. I have decided to approach this app build with basic features of recorded events and necessary attributes. </p>
<p>The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of Storybook app is to allow the user to log events, places, moods and self-reflect from various points of views (calendar, map, photos).</p>
