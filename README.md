<strong>Domain Modeling :: Digital Journaling</strong><br>
Welcome to my simplistic version of digital journaling app.<br>

## About

<p>I have been a long-advocate for having meaningful connection through self-reflection. While some journal apps I have seen simply record special memories and events, some focus more on mental health, mindfulness and self-care. I have decided to approach this app build with basic features of recorded events and necessary attributes. </p>
<p>The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of Storybook app is to allow the user to log events, places, moods and self-reflect from various points of views (calendar, map, photos).</p>

## Build Status and Future Improvement

<p>Storybook was completed in a 2-week timeframe from implementing Rails back-end, ReactJS front-end, Cloudinary API, Google Maps API and Material-UI library. Future cycle of product development as follows:</p>

- [x] Search Bar. Over the time, the user will have many events, and it gets troublesome when the user needs to immediately access a specific event entry. A search bar to quickly type event title and access the journal entry would be useful.
- [x] Add `Friend` to model associations. I envision my app to emulate similar concept such as Instagram. Instead of creating a simple journaling app, what about a social journaling platform. Each user can personalize their privacy whether or not they'd like to share with their friends.

- [x] Adding mood tracker. Current attribute `vibe` to capture my preliminary attempt of gathering user mood data on each event entry. I found a [mood tracker API](https://github.com/drypycode/MoodTracker-API) that I would love to integrate in future project build. User can view their journal entries based on `Mood` under View NavBar.
- [x] Current event entry only allows one image upload. User should be able to upload multiple images, insert GIF and video upload.
- [x] Create a toggle track for dark mode. ðŸ˜Ž
